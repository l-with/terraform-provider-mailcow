This can be used to create and delete OAuth2 clients for mailcow.

## Example Usage

resource "mailcow_oauth2_client" "client" {
  redirect_uri = "https:/redirect.uri"
}

## Schema

### Required

### Read-Only

- `client_id` (String)
- `client_secret` (String, Sensitive)
- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `scope` (String)

## Restriction

The mailcow API does not return the id of the OAuth2 client as response for creation.
As workaround the redirect uri is used as identifier for the resource.
