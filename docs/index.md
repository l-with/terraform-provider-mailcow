# MAILCOW Provider

The provider makes it possible to provision mailcow configurations. 

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "mailcow_domain" "demo" {
  domain = "440044.xyz"
}

resource "mailcow_mailbox" "demo" {
  domain     = mailcow_domain.demo.domain
  local_part = "test"
  password   = "initial secretpassord"
}

resource "mailcow_alias" "demo" {
  address = "alias-demo@${mailcow_domain.demo.domain}"
  goto    = mailcow_mailbox.demo.id
}

resource "mailcow_dkim" "demo" {
  domain = mailcow_domain.demo.domain
  length = 2048
}
```

## Disclaimer

This is under development. You will certainly find bugs and limitations. In those cases, please report issues or, if you can, submit a pull-request.

### To change

* the API of mailcow for tags always [adds the tags instead of replacing](https://github.com/mailcow/mailcow-dockerized/issues/4681). Thus either the API has to be changed or extra resources mailcow_domain_tags and mailcow_mailbox_tag have to be implemented
